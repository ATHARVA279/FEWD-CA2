# Game Idea : 
The idea is to dodge incoming boxes and at the same time you have to kill the zombies coming vertically down.


# Note : the score is calculated by killing the zombies


# How To Play : 
1. You have to dodge the boxes by clicking 'A' and 'D' keys for website view and for the mobile view we can use the buttons provided. 
2. You have to kill zombies by clicking on them.(Use mouse for better experience)

# Brief Idea of Working of the Game : 
The game logic is that we will be moving the car with "A" and "D" keys on the keyboard where I have used requestAnimationFrame for smoother animation of the car, I have also used math.random for the location of the car which will come form any of the three lanes at the same time we have to kill the zombies which will be coming vertically down from both the sides, I have used math.random here also for random zombies once they are killed. I have used onclick for killing the zombies and local storge for storing the name and the score which will be seen at the result page, the sentences of the result page are also stored in an array where again I have used math.random for choosing a sentence once the page has loaded. 


# Special Features in the Game : 
1. There is animation for Car once it hits the box.
2. There are Sound Effects while playing the game. For Example, While clicking on the screen for killing the zombies there is a gun-shot sound and when the car hits the box there is a sound.
3. The Game is Mobile Responsive.
4. There is also a Story page where the olayer will get to know about the story.
