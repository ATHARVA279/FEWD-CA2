            <p >In a world ravaged by a military experiment gone awry, a deadly virus has transformed soldiers and civilians alike into relentless zombies. The remnants of the military have organized a desperate evacuation plan to transport key personnel and valuable resources to a secure location for the last stand against the impending apocalypse.

Your high-tech military vehicle is equipped with advanced weaponry, including machine guns and grenade launchers. The survival of the human race depends on your ability to navigate through the Zombie Warzone, fending off waves of undead and ensuring the safe passage of the convoy.</p>
